# IRIS-DATASET
This project is part of my six-week research study, where I collected and analyzed data on my classmates over a period of 40 days. The objective was to apply Data Analytics techniques and the Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) process, including data collection, cleaning, transformation, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.

Project Overview
The research follows a structured methodology, involving:

Data Collection: Gathering raw datasets from surveys, APIs, or other sources.

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Handling missing values, removing inconsistencies, and deriving new features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Python to visualize and understand patterns in the data.

Predictive Modeling: Applying machine learning techniques to uncover insights and make data-driven predictions.

Data Storytelling: Presenting the findings through compelling visual narratives.

Deliverables Included in this Repository:
✔️ Uncleaned Dataset(s) or API links used for data collection
✔️ Cleaned Dataset (exported using df.to_csv())
✔️ Jupyter Notebooks & PDFs documenting:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
